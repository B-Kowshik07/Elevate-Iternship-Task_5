📊 Product Insights Dashboard 
Welcome to the Product Insights Investigation — where we dive into our product data like detectives solving a case.
Our mission? Crack the code on stock levels, pricing patterns, and availability trends, so our inventory and sales teams can act smart.

🔍 Step 1 — The Stockpile Mystery
Case Question: Which product categories are overflowing and which are running dry?

Why it matters:

Overstock 🏔️ → Ties up money and space.

Understock 🏜️ → Missed sales and unhappy customers.

Our method:

Round up all products by Category.

Count their Stock like tallying supplies in a warehouse.

Rank from biggest mountain of stock to smallest puddle.

Clues we expect to find:

Huge stock + low sales? ➡️ Might need clearance sales.

Tiny stock + high demand? ➡️ Restock before it’s too late!

💰 Step 2 — The Price Tag Puzzle
Case Question: Which categories are the luxury suites and which are the budget rooms?

Why it matters:

High-end categories need premium marketing.

Low-cost categories can win with volume sales.

Our method:

Group by Category again.

Calculate the average price in each.

Rank from “💎 most expensive” to “🪙 cheapest”.

Clues we expect to find:

Pricey categories → require value-driven campaigns.

Cheaper categories → great for attracting first-time buyers.

📦 Step 3 — The Availability Status Story
Case Question: How healthy is our inventory — ready to ship or stuck in limbo?

Why it matters:

Too many Out of Stock items 🚫 → frustrated customers.

Too many Discontinued items 🪦 → product lifecycle churn.

Our method:

Count how many products are In Stock, Backorder, Out of Stock, or Discontinued.

Use a pie chart to make the proportions easy to see.

Clues we expect to find:

High Backorder/Out of Stock → Possible supply chain issues.

High Discontinued → We’re cycling products faster than expected.

📈 Final Case Report — Why This Matters
🛠 Inventory Optimization → Restock winners, clear out slow movers.

🏷 Pricing Strategy → Match marketing tone to product pricing tier.

🚚 Supply Chain Monitoring → Spot problems early and act fast.
